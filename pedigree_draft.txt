Pedigree pipeline:

1) read pedigree file (read_pedigree)
  > ok

2) extract elephant numbers (or calf numbers)
3) blast that list to the database using get_elephant()
4) Return a list of elephants that are unknown so far.
    >>color them in the table and remove from further pipeline, write out that list ("missing elephants")
      (the same will be done for measures and events)

5) Proceed with the elephants that are already known.
6) Check and reject invalid relationships.
    >>color by status (grey: known, red: conflict, white: write out)

Note: add an explicit output of elephant.check() so state that it is present and valid (like [Known])
