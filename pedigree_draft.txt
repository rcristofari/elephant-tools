Pedigree pipeline:

1) read pedigree file (read_pedigree)
2) extract elephant numbers (or calf numbers)
3) blast that list to the database using get_elephant()
4) Return a list of elephants that are unknown so far.
5) Proceed with the elephants that are already known.
6) Check and reject invalid relationships.



Note: add an explicit output of elephant.check() so state that it is present and valid (like [Known])
